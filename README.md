# TI_Amber 

This repository shows my learning progress and some practice of thermodynamic integration (TI) in AMBER20.  
This repository consists of three parts:
- Some basic files and modules of AMBER: [antechamber](http://ambermd.org/tutorials/basic/tutorial4b/) [tleap](http://ambermd.org/tutorials/pengfei/), [pmemd](https://ambermd.org/tutorials/basic/tutorial14/index.php), [cpptraj](http://ambermd.org/tutorials/analysis/tutorial0/index.php).  
- Basic molecular dynamics simulation protocol based on AMBER: the protein-ligand complex in water.    
- Thermodynamic integration (TI) protocol in AMBER: the calculation of binding energy of the complex.
